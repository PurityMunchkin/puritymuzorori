          <div class="contentText">
            <p>I like this right here
This girl she came round the corner Looking like a model Magazine figure. She was shaped like a bottle Long straight hair. She was fly as a bird. First time ever,I was lost for words. Felt so right. Just couldn't be wrong
Love at first sight. If that exists at all,I couldn't move and Felt like I was stuck And then baby girl looked up
 <a href="#">This is what a link looks like.</a></p>
            <br />
        <p>And I said, Hey there pretty brown eyes, Whatcha doing later tonight? Would you mind if I spent a minute with you? </p><br />

        <h1>Contnued lyrics.....</h1>
            <div class="contentText"><p> This girl called Purity, she is a little hottie. She knows she's got it. Came from the Masvingo & so she loves to go to church.
The catholic songs make her move that body. She's dancing all night long. I could tell that she was a wild one.That's why I was shy at first But I finally worked up the nerve</p><br />

        <p>Hey hey little pretty brown eyes, Don'tcha ever be looking at them other guys ,'Cause ain't never had no surfer like me, Start swimming over here and ride my wave, 'Cause I see that you party like there's no tomorrow. Let's leave the party, I'll grab my guitar.  I got the keys, So jump in my car, Sit back, relax, Australia's kinda far.</p><br />
        
          <p>Spend a little bit, A little bit of time with you, Spend a little bit, A little bit of time with you, Spend a little bit, A little bit of time with you , Spend a little bit, A little bit of time with you.</p></div>
        
        
        <h1>My Boo!</h1>
          <div class="contentText"><p>Girl you should know that. I got you on my mind. Your secret admirer. I've been watching you. At night I think of you. I want to be your man, baby. If your game is on, give me a call Boo. If your love is strong, gonna give my all to you. At night I think of you. I want to be your man, baby. If your game is on, give me a call Boo. If your love is strong, gonna give my all to you. Every day I pray my heart can win. Every night I pray I can call you my man, yeah yeah yeah. I need you, I want you. To have you, hold you, squeeze you. So I'm going out every weekend. Just to see my Boo again </p><br />
